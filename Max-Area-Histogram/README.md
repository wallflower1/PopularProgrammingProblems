### Maximum Area Histogram

### Problem - max-area-histogram.cpp
You are given a Histogram, find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.
For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 6}. The largest possible rectangle possible is 12. 

### Maximum area rectangle
This problem uses the same idea can be solved using histogram problem. Problem is you are given a 2D matrix of 0's and 1's. You have to find maximum area rectangle in the matrix. A rectangle is defined as a sub-matrix consisting of only 1's.
